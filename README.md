# Haggle!
## The Pitch!
Haggle! is a game where 1 person is Gamemaster and 4 to 8 players trade for items and information! There are 20 Rules to start! 4 of the rules are public, and 16 are divided up evenly amongst each player. Each rule has information on how much certain items are worth and how to get points. It is the goal of each player to gather as much information as possible and gather the right items together to get the most amount of points by the end of the game. This web app is designed for game masters and players to more easily keep track of items and rules. By the deadline we aim to have a functioning web app that allows the game master to set-up a game of players, create rules and items, and then give those rules and items to players. It will also allow the game master to perform trades between players (players will be assumed to have agreed to this trade outside of the web app), and reflect the change in items and rules for each player, as well as show players a screen detailing all of their current rules and items. 
## User Stories
The Home Page will be a page that welcomes the user and then asks them whether they are a "Player" or the "Game Master".
### Gamemaster
#### Game Setup
Gamemasters start by being greeted with a Game Creation screen where they can add players to the player database. If they've already done this they will instead be sent to the Gamemaster Players screen
